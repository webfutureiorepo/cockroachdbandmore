		// informs the client that the proposal has now been applied, optionally
		// with an error, which may be an AmbiguousResultError).
		//
		// The *ProposalData in the map are "owned" by it. Elements from the
		// map must only be referenced while the Replica.mu is held, except
		// if the element is removed from the map first. Modifying the proposal
		// itself may require holding the raftMu as fields can be accessed
		// underneath raft. See comments on ProposalData fields for synchronization
		// requirements.
		//
		// Due to Raft reproposals, multiple in-flight Raft entries can have the
		// same CmdIDKey. There are two kinds of reproposals:
		//
		// (1) the exact same entry is handed to raft (possibly despite already being
		// present in the log), usually after a timeout[^1].
		//
		// (2)  an existing proposal is updated with a new MaxLeaseIndex and handed to
		// raft, i.e. we're intentionally creating a duplicate. This exists because
		// for pipelined proposals, the client's goroutine returns without waiting
		// for the proposal to apply.[^2][^3] When (2) is carried out, the existing
		// copies of the proposal in the log will be "Superseded", see below. Note
		// that (2) will only be invoked for proposals that aren't currently in the
		// proposals map any more because they're in the middle of being applied;
		// as part of (2), they are re-added to the map.
		//
		// To understand reproposals, we need a broad overview of entry application,
		// which is batched (i.e. may process multiple log entries to be applied in
		// a batched fashion). In entry application, the following steps are taken:
		//
		// 1. retrieve all local proposals: iterate through the entries in order,
		//    and look them up in the proposals map. For each "local" entry (i.e.
		//    tracked in the map), remove it from the map (unless the proposal
		//    is not superseded, see below) and attach the value to the entry.
		// 2. for each entry:
		//    - stage written and in-memory effects of the entry (some may apply as no-ops
		//    if they fail below-raft checks such as the MaxLeaseIndex check)
		//    - Assuming the MaxLeaseIndex is violated and additional constraints are
		//    satisfied, carry out (2) from above. On success, we know now that there
		//    will be a reproposal in the log that can successfully apply. We unbind
		//    the local proposal (so we don't signal it) and apply the current entry
		//    as a no-op.
		// 3. carry out additional side effects of the entire batch (stats updates etc).
		//
		// A prerequisite for (2) is that there currently aren't any copies of the proposal
		// in the log that may ultimately apply, or we risk doubly applying commands - a
		// correctness bug. After (2), any copies of the entry present in the log will have
		// a MaxLeaseIndex strictly less than that of the in-memory command, and will be
		// Superseded() by it.
		//
		// We can always safely create an identical copy (i.e. (1)) because of the
		// replay protection conferred by the MaxLeaseIndex - all but the first
		// proposal (that reach consensus) will be rejected (i.e. apply as a no-op).
		//
		// Naively, one might hope that by invoking (2) upon applying an entry for
		// a command that is rejected due to a MaxLeaseIndex one could achieve the
		// invariant that there is only ever one unapplied copy of the entry in the
		// log, and then the in-memory proposal could reflect the MaxLeaseIndex
		// assigned to this unapplied copy at all times.
		//
		// Unfortunately, for various reasons, this invariant does not hold:
		// - entry application isn't durable, so upon a restart, we might roll
		//   back to a log position that yet has to catch up over multiple previous
		//   incarnations of (2), i.e. we will see the same entry multiple times at
		//   various MaxLeaseIndex values.
		//   (This technically not a problem, since we're losing the in-memory proposal
		//   during the restart anyway, but should be kept in mind anyway).
		// - Raft proposal forwarding due to (1)-type reproposals could "in
		//   principle" lead to an old copy of the entry appearing again in the
		//   unapplied log, at least if we make the reasonable assumption that
		//   forwarded proposals may arrive at the leader with arbitrary delays.
		//
		// As a result, we can't "just" invoke (2) when seeing a rejected command,
		// we additionally have to verify that there isn't a more recent reproposal
		// underway that could apply successfully and supersedes the one we're
		// currently looking at.
		// So we carry out (2) only if the MaxLeaseIndex of the in-mem proposal matches
		// that of the current entry, and update the in-mem MaxLeaseIndex with the result
		// of (2) if it did.
		//
		// An example follows. Consider the following situation (where N is some base
		// index not relevant to the example) in which we have one inflight proposal which
		// has been triplicated in the log (due to [^1]):
		//
		//     proposals[id] = p{Cmd{MaxLeaseIndex: 100, ...}}
		//
		//     ... (unrelated entries)
		//     raftlog[N] = Cmd{MaxLeaseIndex: 100, ...}
		//     ... (unrelated entries)
		//     raftlog[N+12] = (same as N)
		//     ... (unrelated entries)
		//     raftlog[N+15] = (same as N)
		//
		// where we assume that the `MaxLeaseIndex` 100 is invalid, i.e. when we see
		// the first copy of the command being applied, we've already applied some
		// command with equal or higher `MaxLeaseIndex`. In a world without
		// mechanism (2), `N` would be rejected, and would finalize the proposal
		// (i.e. signal the client with an error and remove the entry from
		// `proposals`). Later, `N+12` and `N+15` would similarly be rejected (but
		// they wouldn't even be regarded as local proposals any more due to not
		// being present in `proposals`).
		//
		// However, (2) exists and it will engage during application of `N`: realizing
		// that the current copies of the entry are all going to be rejected, it will
		// modify the proposal by assigning a new `MaxLeaseIndex` to it, and handing
		// it to `(*Replica).propose` again (which hands it to the proposal buffer,
		// which will at some point flush it, leading to re-insertion into the raft
		// log and the `proposals` map). The result will be this picture:
		//
		//     proposals[id] = p{Cmd{MaxLeaseIndex: 192, ...}}   <-- modified
		//
		//     ... (unrelated entries)
		//     raftlog[N] = Cmd{MaxLeaseIndex: 100, ...}         <-- applied (as no-op)
		//     ... (unrelated entries)
		//     raftlog[N+12] = (same as N)                       (superseded)
		//     ... (unrelated entries)
		//     raftlog[N+15] = (same as N)                       (superseded)
		//     ... (unrelated entries)
		//     raftlog[N+18] = Cmd{MaxLeaseIndex: 192, ...}      <-- modified
		//
		// `N+18` might (in fact, is likely to) apply successfully. As a result, when
		// we consider `N+12` or `N+15` for application, we must *not* carry out (2)
		// again, or we break replay protection. In other words, the `MaxLeaseIndex`
		// of the command being applied must be compared with the `MaxLeaseIndex` of
		// the command in the proposals map; only if they match do we know that this
		// is the most recent (in MaxLeaseIndex order) copy of the command, and only
		// then can (2) engage. In addition, an entry that doesn't pass this equality
		// check must not signal the proposer and/or unlink from the proposals map (as a
		// newer reproposal which might succeed is likely in the log)[^4].
		//
		// Another way of framing the above is that `proposals[id].Cmd.MaxLeaseIndex`
		// actually tracks the maximum `MaxLeaseIndex` of all copies that may be present in
		// the log.
		//
		// If (2) results in an error (for example, since the proposal now fails to
		// respect the closed timestamp), that error will finalize the proposal and
		// is returned to the client.

	// However, we do permit exactly two forms of requests when a range is in

	//
	// The first request type that we allow on the RHS of a merge after it has
	// entered its critical phase is a Subsume request. This sounds backwards,

	// will trigger the installation of a mergeComplete channel after it is
	// executed, it may sometimes execute after the mergeComplete channel has
	// been installed. Consider the case where the RHS replica acquires a new
	// lease after the merge transaction deletes its local range descriptor but
	// before the Subsume command is sent. The lease acquisition request will
	// notice the intent on the local range descriptor and install a
	// mergeComplete channel. If the forthcoming Subsume blocked on that
	// channel, the merge transaction would deadlock.
	//
	// This exclusion admits a small race condition. If a Subsume request is
	// sent to the right-hand side of a merge, outside of a merge transaction,
	// after the merge has committed but before the RHS has noticed that the
	// merge has committed, the request may return stale data. Since the merge
	// has committed, the LHS may have processed writes to the keyspace
	// previously owned by the RHS that the RHS is unaware of. This window
	// closes quickly, as the RHS will soon notice the merge transaction has
	// committed and mark itself as destroyed, which prevents it from serving
	// all traffic, including Subsume requests.
	//
	// In our current, careful usage of Subsume, this race condition is
	// irrelevant. Subsume is only sent from within a merge transaction, and
	// merge transactions read the RHS descriptor at the beginning of the
	// transaction to verify that it has not already been merged away.
	if ba.IsSingleSubsumeRequest() {
		return nil
	}
	// The second request type that we allow on the RHS of a merge after it has
	// entered its critical phase is a Refresh request, but only one issued by
	// the active range merge transaction itself, targeting the RHS's local
	// range descriptor. This is necessary to allow the merge transaction to
	// have its write timestamp be bumped and still commit without retrying. In
	// such cases, the transaction must refresh its reads, including its
	// original read on the RHS's local range descriptor. If we were to block
	// this refresh on the frozen RHS range, the merge would deadlock.
	//
	// On the surface, it seems unsafe to permit Refresh requests on an already
	// subsumed RHS range, because the Refresh's effect on the timestamp cache
	// will never make it to the LHS leaseholder. This risks the future joint
	// range serving a write that invalidates the Refresh. However, in this
	// specific situation, we can be sure that such a serializability violation
	// will not occur because the Range merge also writes to (deletes) this key.
	// This means that if the Range merge transaction commits, its intent on the
	// key will be resolved to the timestamp of the refresh and no future write
	// will ever be able to violate the refresh. Conversely, if the Range merge
	// transaction does not commit, then the merge will fail and the update to
	// the RHS's timestamp cache will not be lost (not that this particularly
	// matters in cases of aborted transactions).
	//
	// The same line of reasoning as the one above has motivated us to explore
	// removing keys from a transaction's refresh spans when they are written to
	// by the transaction, as the intents written by the transaction act as a
	// form of pessimistic lock that obviate the need for the optimistic
	// refresh. Such an improvement would eliminate the need for this special
	// case, but until we generalize the mechanism to prune refresh spans based

// TODO(ajwerner):  There is one false negative where false will be returned but
// the hard state may be due to a newer replica which is outlined below. It
// should be safe.
// Ideally if this store had ever learned that the replica created by the split
// were removed it would not forget that fact. There exists one edge case where
// the store may learn that it should house a replica of the same range with a
// higher replica ID and then forget. If the first raft message this store ever
// receives for the this range contains a replica ID higher than the replica ID
// in the split trigger then an in-memory replica at that higher replica ID will
// be created and no tombstone at a lower replica ID will be written. If the
// server then crashes it will forget that it had ever been the higher replica
// ID. The server may then proceed to process the split and initialize a replica
// at the replica ID implied by the split. This is potentially problematic as
// the replica may have voted as this higher replica ID and when it rediscovers
// the higher replica ID it will delete all of the state corresponding to the
// older replica ID including its hard state which may have been synthesized
// with votes as the newer replica ID. This case tends to be handled safely in
// practice because the replica should only be receiving messages as the newer
// replica ID after it has been added to the range as a learner.
//
// Despite the safety due to the change replicas protocol explained above it'd
// be good to know for sure that a replica ID for a range on a store is always
// monotonically increasing, even across restarts.
